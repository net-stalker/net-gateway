In the old version of resutl and quic
They have the following flow
1) Create ServerConfig
2) Create ClientConfig
Both of them need certificates to make the connection possible, or we must use unsecure connection (which I really don't know where to look for
in a new version of rustls)
3) Create server endpoint using Endpoint::server(server_config, bind_addr)
Then server will ba able to accept connections and perform communication with endpoints
4) Create client endpoint using Endpoint::client(bind_addr), client.set_default_client_config(client_config)
The client will then be able to connect to the server and perform communication
